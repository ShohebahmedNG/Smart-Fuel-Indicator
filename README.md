# Smart-Fuel-Indicator
The proposed fuel indicator in vehicle utilizes simple and digital visuals for indicating the amount of fuel in the fuel tank. This overcomes the major drawback of analog fuel gauge present in the vehicles. In a resistive type fuel gauge, the sending unit contains a float, whose one end is mounted to the potentiometer and the other end in the fuel. The potentiometer value is varied according to the level of fuel present in the tank. Hence, there is a need for a better system Digital fuel gauge displays on the other hand the amount of fuel left in the tanker by measuring its quantity in terms of liters instead of indicating the level which leads to better accuracy and mileage calculations for the us
